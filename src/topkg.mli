      shows that alternatives like having an OCaml module generated
      with the appropriate information doesn't work well in
      practice. Version numbers do not only show up in OCaml source
      code. They also appear in documentation comments, metadata
      files, textual data files and non-OCaml source files. Having by
      default the whole distribution being watermarked allows one to
      write %â%VERSION%% in any context and be sure it will be
      substituted with the right version number in pin and distribution
      contexts (this occurence was not subsituted because a ZERO
      WIDTH NON-JOINER U+200C was introduced between the first
      two percent characters). If this scheme poses a problem for certain
      files simply filter out the result of {!files_to_watermark} or

(** {1:manual Manual}

{!Topkg} is a package builder for distributing OCaml software. It
provides a mechanism to describe an opam
{{:http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/manual/dev-manual.html#sec25}[.install]
file} according to the build environment and make corresponding
invocations in your build system. This simple mechanism brings the
following advantages:
{ol
{- It frees you from implementing an install procedure in your build
   system: this task is delegated to {{:http://opam.ocaml.org}OPAM} or
   to the [opam-installer] tool.}
{- It doesn't reclaim control over your build system. It will only
   invoke it {e once} with a list of targets determined from a package
   description and a build environment explicitely specified on the
   command line.}}

{!Topkg} has been designed with [ocamlbuild] in mind but it should be
usable with any other build system as long as it is able to understand
the targets topkg {{!map}generates}.

{!Topkg} is a single ISC licensed OCaml library without dependencies
that you add to you project build dependencies. It also provides the
[topkg] command line tool that will help you to streamline your
release process.

{1:setup Basic setup}

Your repository and distribution archive should have the following files.
{ul
{- [pkg/META], a
    {{:http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html}Findlib}
    [META] file. That you should install in the [lib] directory
    of the package (see below).}
{- [pkg/pkg.ml], the package description written with {!Topkg}.
   See {{!descr}package description.}}
{- [_tags] ocamlbuild file with at least the [true : bin_annot] line.
   See {{!cmt}handling cmt and cmti} files for details.}
{- [opam], your package metadata, its dependencies and the instructions
   to build it. The [depends:] fields must have a ["topkg" {build}] line.}
{- [README.md], your readme file (the actual file path can be changed via
   the [readme_file] argument of {!Pkg.describe} FIXME).}
{- [LICENSE.md], your license file (the actual file path can be changed via
   the [license_file] argument of {!Pkg.describe} FIXME).}
{- [CHANGES.md], your change log file (the actual file path can be changed via
   the [changes_file] argument of {!Pkg.describe} FIXME).}}

{b Note.} If you start a new library,
{{:http://erratique.ch/software/carcass}[carcass]} allows
you to:
{v
carcass body topkg/pkg mypkg
(cd mypkg && git init && git add . && git commit -m "First commit.")
opam pin add -kgit mypkg mypkg#master
v}
to make your library [{opam,ocamlfind}]-able with correct version
watermarks on releases and opam pins.

{1:build Package build instructions}

The build instructions of your package are simply an invocation of
[pkg/pkg.ml] with the [build] argument and a specification of the
build environment on the command line. Here is for example how you
should write that invocation in the [build:] field of the [opam] file
of a hypothetical [mypkg] package:
{v
build: [[
  "ocaml" "pkg/pkg.ml" "build"
          "installer" "true" ]]
v}

This invocation will execute your build system with a set of targets
determined from the build environment specified on the command line
and generate, in the root directory of your distribution a
[mypkg.install] file that OPAM will use to install and uninstall your
package.

Note that there is no need to specify anything in the [remove:] field
of the [opam] file and there is no need to invoke [ocamlfind] with
your [META] file, simply install the latter in the [lib] section (see below).

If you need to support another package system you can invoke
[pkg/pkg.ml] as above and then manage the installation and
uninstallation at a given [$DESTDIR] using the generated
[mypkg.install] file and the [opam-installer] tool distributed with
OPAM or you own [.install] file interpreter.

{1:descr Package description}

An OPAM [.install] file is a description of a standard UNIX
install. It has fields for each of the standard directories [lib],
[bin], [man], [etc], etc. Each of these fields lists the files to
install in the corresponding directory (or subdirectories). See the
{{:http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/manual/dev-manual.html#sec25}[.install]
file specification} in the OPAM developer manual for more information.

In {!Topkg}, the package description file [pkg/pkg.ml] is simply:
{ol
{- A {{!section:Pkg.builder}builder specification}. It specifies the
   build tool that is invoked once with the files to build and install
   as determined by the current build environment.}
{- A specification of the files to install according to the build
   environment by specifying invoking install field functions.

one wants build to put in each field
   of the package's [.install] file by invoking install field
   functions [Pkg.{lib,bin,doc,...}]}}

Here is an example of a [pkg/build.ml] description for a single module
library that also installs a command line tool called [jsontrip]. Don't
worry about the sheer length of the description we'll soon cut down
on the number of lines.
{[
#!/usr/bin/env ocaml
#use "topfind"
#require "topkg"
open Topkg

let () =
  Pkg.describe "jsonm" ~builder:(`OCamlbuild []) [
    Pkg.lib "pkg/META";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.mli";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmti";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmi";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cma";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmx";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.a";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmxa";
    Pkg.lib "src/jsonm.cmxs";
    Pkg.bin "test/jsontrip.byte";
    Pkg.bin "test/jsontrip.native";
    Pkg.doc "README.md";
    Pkg.doc "CHANGES.md"; ]
]}

This says that we are declaring a package named [jsonm] which means
that the generated install file will be [jsonm.install]. It also says
that we are using [ocamlbuild] as a build tool and that we want all the
files specified with [Pkg.lib] to be installed the [lib] directory,
those with [Pkg.bin] in [bin], those with [Pkg.doc] in [doc] etc.

{b Tip.} If you are using
{{:https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin}[merlin]} and [emacs],
issue a [M-x merlin-use topkg], to get merlin support for editing
the package description.

Now there are two things that are unsatisfactory with the above
declaration.

{ol
{- The set of files to generate for a library is usually always the
   same and it's painful to write them down explicitely. This
   is solved by [extension sets](#extension-sets).}
{- For the binaries, we usually don't want to install both byte and
   native code. We want to install one tool without the [byte] or
   [native] suffix, and the native one if available. This is solved
   by [auto binaries](#auto-binaries)}}

Using these features the above declaration can be reduced to:
{[
let () =
  Pkg.describe "jsonm" ~builder:(`OCamlbuild []) [
    Pkg.lib "pkg/META";
    Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/jsonm";
    Pkg.bin ~auto:true "test/jsontrip";
    Pkg.doc "README.md";
    Pkg.doc "CHANGES.md"; ]
]}
Optional builds and installs are handled by declaring boolean keys
specified on the command line (see [Environment](#environment)) and
using the [cond] optional argument of install field functions (see
[Conditions](#conditions)). The following example compiles the
[vgr_pdf] library only if both Uutf and Otfm are present and
[vgr_htmlc] only if js_of_ocaml is present:

{[
let uutf = Env.bool "uutf"
let otfm = Env.bool "otfm"
let jsoo = Env.bool "jsoo"
let vgr_pdf = uutf && otfm
let () =
  Pkg.describe "vg" ~builder:(`OCamlbuild []) [
    Pkg.lib "pkg/META";
    Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/vg";
    Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/vgr_svg";
    Pkg.lib ~cond:vgr_pdf ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/vgr_pdf";
    Pkg.bin ~cond:vgr_pdf ~auto:true "test/vecho";
    Pkg.lib ~cond:jsoo ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/vgr_htmlc";
    Pkg.doc "README.md";
    Pkg.doc "CHANGES.md";
    Pkg.doc "test/min_htmlc.html";
    Pkg.doc "test/min_htmlc.ml";
    Pkg.doc "test/min_pdf.ml";
    Pkg.doc "test/min_svg.ml"; ]
]}

{1:exts Extension sets}

The install field functions have an optional [exts] argument. If
present these extensions are appended to the path given to the
function. The module [[Exts]](pkg/topkg.ml#L23) defines a few
predefined extension sets. For example a module library implemented in
[src/mylib.ml] can be declared by:
{[
Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/mylib"
]}
which is, effectively, a shortcut for:
{[
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.mli";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmti";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmi";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmx";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cma";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.a";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmxa";
Pkg.lib "src/mylib.cmxs";
]}

{1:autobin Auto binaries}

For generating an installing native binaries if native code
compilation is available and byte code binaries if not you can use the
[auto] optional argument of [Pkg.bin] and [Pkg.sbin]. Using it with
[true] you can simply specify the binary name prefix. It will use the
base name as the name of the tool and ask for either a [.native] or
[.byte] target depending if native compilation is available or not.

{[
Pkg.bin ~auto:true "src/mybinary"
]}

{1:conds Conditions}

Conditional installation is handled through the optional argument
[cond] of install field functions. If [cond] is [false] it's neither
built nor installed. For example for a library that depends on the
presence of another:

{[
let otherlib = Env.bool "otherlib"
...
Pkg.lib ~cond:otherlib ~exts:Exts.module_library "src/mylib"
]}

Conditions related to native code and native code dynamic linking
availability happen automatically:

* In [Pkg.lib] paths ending with [.cmxs] are dropped if
  [Env.native_dynlink] is [false] and paths ending with
  [.a], [.cmx], [.cmxa] and [.cmxs] are dropped if
  [Env.native] is [false].

* In [Pkg.{bin,sbin}] path ending with [.native] are dropped
  if [Env.native] is false.

{1:env Environment}

New boolean keys are added to the environment by calling [Env.bool
key]. To output a sample environment you can invoke the build script with
[--help]:

    ocaml pkg/pkg.ml --help

{1:rename Renaming and installing in subdirectories}

By default install field functions use the basename of the path given
to the function as the install name. If you need to rename the build
artefact or install to a subdirectory you can use the [dst]
optional argument of install field functions. For example for a
library that needs to be installed in a [subdir] subdirectory of
[lib] use:

{[
Pkg.lib ~exts:Exts.module_library ~dst:"subdir/mylib" "src/mylib"
]}

{1:cmt Handling cmt and cmti files}

Since the OCaml tools generate [.cmt] and [.cmti] files only as a side
effect they are treated specially: they are not built. For
[ocamlbuild] you should add this line to your [_tags] file:
{[
true : bin_annot
]}
this will build them as a side effect of other build invocations. In
the [$PKG.install] file generated by topkg the [cmt] and [cmti] files
are prefixed by a ? so that if they are not built (pre OCaml 4.01 for
[ocamlbuild]) the install doesn't fail.

{1:verify Verifying the build invocation and .install generation}

For verifying the build invocation and the generated [.install] file
you can invoke [build.ml] with [explain] as the first argument:

    ocaml pkg/pkg.ml explain installer false ...

This will not invoke the build system but output on stdout diagnostic
information aswell as the build invocation and the generated
[$PKG.install] file.

In contrast to the build invocation it is allowed to invoke [explain]
with an empty or partial environment.

    ocaml pkg/pkg.ml explain

In that case it will use [true] for each unspecified environment
boolean key.

{1:map Map from descriptions to targets and build artefacts}

Given an invocation [Pkg.{lib,bin,...} "$PATH"], the system generates
a target [$PATH] for your build system and expects to find the build
artefact in [$BUILD/$PATH] where [$BUILD] is the build directory of
the build tool (e.g. [_build] for [ocamlbuild]).

{1:config Storing build environment information in a build}

The following sample setup shows how to store build environment
information in a build. The setup also works seamlessly during
development if build artefacts are invoked from the root directory of
the source repository.

In this example we store the location of the install's [etc] directory
in the build artefacts. We have the following file layout in our
source repository:
{v
etc/mypkg.conf       # Configuration file
src/mypkg_etc.ml     # Module with path to the etc dir
v}

the contents of [src/mypkg_etc.ml] is simply:
{[
(* This file is overwritten by release builds. During development it
   refers to the [etc] directory at the root directory of the
   source repository. *)

let dir = "etc"
]}
the value [Mypkg_etc.dir] is used in the sources to refer to the [etc]
directory of the install. In the package description file
[pkg/pkg.ml] we have the following lines:
{[
let etc_dir = Env.string "etc-dir"
let etc_config = function
| `Dev -> Ok () (* Do nothing, the repo src/mypkg_etc.ml will do *)
| `Pin | `Distrib ->
    let config = strf "let dir = %S" etc_dir in
    OS.File.write "src/mypkg_etc.ml" config

let () =
  let build = Pkg.build ~pre:etc_config in
  Pkg.describe ~build [
  ...
  Pkg.etc "etc/mpypkg.conf";
  ... ]
]}
and the [opam] build instructions are:
{v
build:
[[ "ocaml" "pkg/pkg.ml" "build"
           "installer" "true"
           "etc-dir" "%{mypkg:etc}%" ]]
v}

{1:trouble Troubleshooting}

More information run with TOPKG_VERBOSITY=debug, if you are troubleshooting
a pin build dont forget to add [--verbose] to [opam] itself.
